		"bio": "Itâ€™s said that a picture is worth one thousand words;  words that form an orchestra of emotion and a symphony of thought within the observer. I am Jacob Rypien. and my goal is to conduct these words through my photography. The only concentration of my photography is that of the story. To accurately depict these stories, I implement various styles and editing techniques that when conjoint the observer transcends the various levels of emotion and thought of the story. I find a photograph to be quite individualistic in terms of the perception of the story. In my future endeavors I would like to create zines that develop the perception of the work to be more communal, allowing for a more collaborative story. After all, isn't that the purpose of a story; to be shared?"
